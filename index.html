			 <h2>Myself 🙋‍♂️🇫🇷🇰🇷</h2>
			 <p>Hello everyone, my name is Daniel Lee, and I'm a half-fench 🇫🇷 half-corean 🇰🇷 18 years old guy. I am currently living in Singapore, where I am studying at ESSEC Business school in their bachelor program. I have some passions I want to talk to you about, so keep on scrolling down!</p>

			<h2>Traveling ✈️</h2>
			<p>
				I love traveling, I've been to a lot of countries in my life and my goal is to go to all of them during my life (Sounds crazy I know), but that is really something I enjoy doing. When I'm abrooad, I can really disconnect and learn new culture and way of life.

			 <h2>Video Games 🎮</h2>
			 <p>I also love video games like every 18 years old, I prefer the solo games like Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto V, The Last Of Us or Uncharted. I love discovering every detail of their universe and fully complete the game (I'm a 100% player),but my favorite game is and will always be <em>Lapins Cretin: La Grande Aventure</em>, I have so much memories of me playing with my brother and my dad during my childhood!</p>

		<div class="card-white">
		 <h2>Money 💸</h2>
			 <p>I also love money, like everyone, but I love making money on my own with different side hustle like tutoring, because to study in Singapore I had to take out a student loan (it is one of the most expensive cities in the world, I should have searched more). My goal is to reduce my mensualties during my studies to loose less money when I will reimburse it in 5 years.</p>
